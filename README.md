- A MULTIMODEL AI SYSTEM SHOULD BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND TEXT, VIDEO CONTENT

## Step 1 - learn Gradio
Great for making quick UI in python, that will run in browser. It also has hot reloading.

fn: The function to wrap a user interface (UI) around
inputs: the Gradio component(s) to use for the input. The number of components should match the number of arguments in your function.
outputs: the Gradio component(s) to use for the output. The number of components should match the number of return values from your function.

Gradio includes more than 30 built-in components 

Tip:
 For the `inputs` and `outputs` arguments, you can pass in the name of these components as a string (`"textbox"`) or an instance of the class (`gr.Textbox()`).

## Sharing Demo
 demo.launch(share=True)  # Share your demo with just 1 extra parameter.
 ### Why did not hot reloading worked?



### Learn - Gradio.Blocks
Gradio offers a low-level approach for designing web apps with more customizable layouts and data flows with the gr.Blocks class. Blocks supports things like controlling where components appear on the page, handling multiple data flows and more complex interactions (e.g. outputs can serve as inputs to other functions), and updating properties/visibility of components based on user interaction â€” still all in Python.

### learn - Gradio.ChatInterface
 Always set type="messages" in gr.ChatInterface. The default value (type="tuples") is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Gradio.
 Better to use gr.ChatBot for more ui options
 gr.ChatInterface also supports markdown (I did not try it thou)
