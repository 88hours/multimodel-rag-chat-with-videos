00:00.000 --> 00:08.760
 Black holes are among the most fascinating objects in our universe, and also the most

00:08.760 --> 00:13.520
 mysterious.

00:13.520 --> 00:19.040
 A black hole is a region in space where the force of gravity is so strong, not even light,

00:19.040 --> 00:23.200
 the fastest known entity in our universe can escape.

00:23.200 --> 00:28.680
 The boundary of a black hole is called the event horizon, a point of no return beyond

00:28.680 --> 00:31.840
 which we truly cannot see.

00:31.840 --> 00:37.040
 When something crosses the event horizon, it collapses into the black hole's singularity,

00:37.040 --> 00:42.400
 an infinitely small, infinitely dense point where space, time, and the laws of physics

00:42.400 --> 00:46.200
 no longer apply.

00:46.200 --> 00:51.400
 Scientists have theorized several different types of black holes, with stellar and supermassive

00:51.400 --> 00:54.280
 black holes being the most common.

00:54.280 --> 00:58.640
 Stolar black holes form when massive stars die and collapse.

00:58.640 --> 01:05.080
 They're roughly 10 to 20 times the mass of our sun, and scattered throughout the universe.

01:05.080 --> 01:11.040
 There could be millions of these stellar black holes in the Milky Way alone.

01:11.040 --> 01:16.440
 Supermassive black holes are giants by comparison, measuring millions, even billions of times

01:16.440 --> 01:19.440
 more massive than our sun.

01:19.440 --> 01:23.800
 Scientists can only guess how they form, but we do know they exist at the center of just

01:23.800 --> 01:28.920
 about every large galaxy, including our own.

01:28.920 --> 01:33.760
 Sagittarius A, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, has a mass

01:33.760 --> 01:39.360
 of roughly four million suns, and has a diameter about the distance between the Earth and our

01:39.360 --> 01:41.960
 sun.

01:41.960 --> 01:46.680
 Because black holes are invisible, the only way for scientists to detect and study them

01:46.680 --> 01:50.040
 is to observe their effect on nearby matter.

01:50.040 --> 01:55.360
 This includes accretion disks, a disk of particles that form when gases and dust fall toward a

01:55.360 --> 02:03.920
 black hole, and quasars, jets of particles that blast out of supermassive black holes.

02:03.920 --> 02:08.720
 Black holes remained largely unknown until the 20th century.

02:08.720 --> 02:14.840
 In 1916, using Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, a German physicist named Karl

02:14.840 --> 02:20.280
 Schwartzschild calculated that any mass could become a black hole if it were compressed tightly

02:20.280 --> 02:22.640
 enough.

02:22.640 --> 02:27.480
 But it wasn't until 1971 when theory became reality.

02:27.480 --> 02:34.000
 Astronomers, studying the constellation Cygnus, discovered the first black hole.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.440
 An untold number of black holes are scattered throughout the universe, constantly warping

02:39.440 --> 02:45.600
 space and time, altering entire galaxies, and endlessly inspiring both scientists and

02:45.600 --> 02:47.120
 our collective imagination.
